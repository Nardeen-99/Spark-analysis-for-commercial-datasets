# Spark-analysis-for-commercial-datasets
The objective of this project is to analyse various datasets that have large number of rows in spark the datasets are about commercial products and rating of e-commerce website NewChic.com.
For this project there are three csv files one for each product ( Shoe products, jewelry products and accessories).The datasets are available in the zip folder with th project.I advise you have the notebook and all the csv files in the same directory, so that it is easier when you are loading the csv files to pass in the csv files directly since they will be in the same directory as the notebook.
